# HertzScript Coroutine Dispatcher

The HertzScript coroutine dispatcher executes code that was compiled by the [HertzScript Compiler](https://github.com/Floofies/hertzscript-compiler).

See the [HertzScript Specification](https://github.com/Floofies/hertzscript-specification) repository for more information.

Documentation for the dispatcher itself will be added to this repository in the future.
