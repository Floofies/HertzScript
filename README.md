# HertzScript

:seedling: This project is in early alpha.

HertzScript (abbreviated "HzScript") takes your regular existing JavaScript source code as input, and transforms it into an interruptable coroutine system with voluntary preemption. A new keyword is introduced named `spawn` which allows you to run several functions concurrently.

This project is part of a larger effort to implement preemptively multitasked Green threads in (and only in) JavaScript, and was initially created as the core executor of the [Hertzfeld Kernel](https://github.com/Floofies/hertzfeld-kernel).

## FAQ

**Q:** *What problem does HertzScript solve?*

**A:** In regular JavaScript, if another function is busy executing just as a `setTimeout` timer reaches itâ€™s scheduled deadline, then that timer will miss the deadline. If you want to have reliable multitasking in a single process, this problem presents a significant roadblock, and reduces the overall multitasking capacity while adding significant jitter to the system. With concurrency, constructs such as an asynchronous event loop become obsolete, and reliable multitasking can be achieved.

**Q:** *How does it solve that problem?*

**A:**  By adding concurrent execution to your existing JavaScript source code, automatically transforming all subroutines into interruptible coroutines, and eliminating run-time blocking by giving you the ability to interrupt/preempt/pause any JavaScript function's execution at nearly any point in the control flow. You can use an optional `spawn` keyword to start new coroutines.

**Q:** *Why would I need this?*

**A:** You need this if you feel that the asynchronous JS event loop is slowly killing you. HertzScript allows developers to reliably multitask between several functions on a single thread without manually implementing it or using the event loop. If you're already manually writing cooperatively multitasked source code, and/or need reliable single-process multitasking, then HzScript could take over this responsibility for you. If you're implementing [Green threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads), then the HzScript dispatcher could serve as an executor for each thread.

## High-Level Synopsis

HzScript consists of a [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) transformation plugin, an [Acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn) parser plugin, and a coroutine dispatcher with which to execute the resulting source code.

Normally, coroutines are reserved for cooperative multitasking, but HertzScript implements a special type named voluntary preemptive multitasking. In regular cooperative-style programmers must declare points at which programs will yield, and HzScript extends this concept by automating it.

The source code HzScript produces can be output in one of two forms:

	1. A self-running platform-agnostic JavaScript module which transparently integrates with existing software.

	2. A specialized HzModule which can be directly imported into a coroutine dispatcher.
	
Babel is used to transform all source code so that it is able to run concurrently, and Acorn is used to parse a special `spawn` keyword which acts as the primary interface to utilize this concurrency.

## Theory of Operation

HertzScript uses a multi-stage source-to-source compilation pipeline to transform JavaScript functions into instruction streams. To facilitate such a transformation while preserving normal JavaScript execution, a coroutine dispatcher which implements the instruction set must be used to execute the compiled source code.

The first stage in the compilation pipeline is Acorn, an Acorn parser plugin, and Acorn-Walk, which are used to parse and transform any `SpawnExpression` to a regular method call for the secondary compilation stage to recognize. The second stage is Babel and a Babel transformation plugin which is used to transform all function expressions/statements into GeneratorFunctions. Within the new GeneratorFunctions, all CallExpressions, NewExpressions, ReturnStatements, YieldExpressions, and SpawnExpressions are transformed into yielded HertzScript instructions.

HertzScript changes how the call stack is utilized in a JavaScript VM, and as a side effect it loosely limits that stack to a set length. When a new coroutine is started, a new Coroutine Control Block is created for it which encapsulates all state the coroutine requires to function. Within each Control Block is a virtual call stack, and the HzScript instruction set corresponds with operations which push and pop the coroutines from that stack. Instead of storing user functions in the JavaScript VM call stack, they are stored in the virtual call stacks within each Coroutine Control Block.

The "real" call stack will generally consist of the coroutine dispatcher, and the currently executing coroutine will reside at the end of the stack; the stack does not grow past this point except during function calls which were initiated by many of JavaScript's standard operators which are not the invocation operator. The end result of this size reduction is that all coroutines are generally able to perform a context switch with `O(1)` time complexity, significantly reducing any possible jitter that would critically impact multitasking operation.

## Concurrent Programming with `spawn`

Due to the single-threaded nature of JavaScript, only one function may be run at any time, but HertzScript allows you to utilize concurrency via a new keyword named `spawn`. If you call a function which is preceded by the `spawn` keyword, then the function will run concurrently alongside any other functions, including the caller function!

### Example: Busy-Wait Timers

In the below example, we call two functions which [busy-wait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting). Using a busy-wait does not make any sense in any JavaScript execution environment, however it is an easy way to demonstrate how HertzScript provides concurrency.

The first busy-wait duration is 5000ms, while the second one is 1000ms. You can probably guess what happens when you execute this script.

```JavaScript
const performance = require("perf_hooks").performance;

function sleep(ms) {
	const start = performance.now();
	const end = start + ms;
	while (performance.now() < end);
	console.log("Slept for " + (performance.now() - start) + "ms");
}

sleep(5000);
sleep(1000);
```

The following will be logged to console:

```
Slept for 5000ms
Slept for 1000ms
```

As expected, the order of each log indicates that the second busy-wait had to wait until the first busy-wait had completed.

If we invoke our two busy-wait functions using `spawn`, then they do not block each other from executing, and their logs swap positions:

```JavaScript
spawn sleep(5000);
spawn sleep(1000);
```

The above code would then log something like this:

```
Slept for 1000ms
Slept for 5000ms
```

### Example: RedLight GreenLight with Channels

In the game Statues, a designated person (the "Curator") calls out "stop" and "go" commands to the other players.

In the below example, a Curator is created whith three methods, `redLight`, `greenLight`, and `quit`. We then `spawn` two "players" which infintiely loop, checking to see if the Curator has given a different command. Every time the command changes, the players log it to console. If the Curator gives a command to stop the game, then the players `break` out of their infinite loops.

```JavaScript
function Curator(channel) {
	channel.write("Wait...");
	this.redLight = () => channel.write("Red Light!");
	this.greenLight = () => channel.write("Green Light!");
	this.quit = () => channel.write("Quit!");
}

function player(name, channel) {
	const reader = new Channel.Reader(channel);
	var lastCommand = "";
	// Loop forever!
	while (true) {
		const command = reader.read();
		if (command && command !== lastCommand) {
			console.log(name + ": " + command);
			if (command === "Quit!") break;
			lastCommand = command;
		}
	}
}

const Channel = require("./Channel.js");
const channel = new Channel("string");
const curator = new Curator(channel);

spawn player("Player 1", channel);
spawn player("Player 2", channel);

curator.redLight();
curator.greenLight();
curator.redLight();
curator.greenLight();
curator.quit();
```

The above code logs the following to console:

```
Player 1: Wait...
Player 2: Wait...
Player 1: Red Light!
Player 2: Red Light!
Player 1: Green Light!
Player 2: Green Light!
Player 1: Red Light!
Player 2: Red Light!
Player 1: Green Light!
Player 2: Green Light!
Player 1: Quit!
Player 2: Quit!
```
